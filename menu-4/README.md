# Menu 4

This is a example of nav bar with nice frosted glass effect.

# About my code

I used HTML and CSS for basic. I added some Javascript for menu bar, localstorage for save menu state and hiding menu with event target. I know that i can add more styling into mobile version, maybe someday.

# Note

Im using free stuff and writing code for educational purpose.
